# social-camel

In social-camel two agents discuss a common topic where each of the agents has a different perspective. For example a student and a teacher discussing why 2 and 2 is 4 where the stuents perspective is that they do not understand this and the teacher has a good understanding and explains it. This allows for several interesting use cases such as exploring conversations between a doctor or a patient, etc. 

social-camel is an extension of the example from https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/agents/camel_role_playing.html. The ogirinal CAMEL allows to sandbox two agents that can give each others intructions to solve a task.
